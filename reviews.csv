"I love all the quirky, funny subs like What could go wrong? and Don't dead open inside. Also, animal videos like Barkour! I'm so glad that the subs I look at are not full of gross and vulgar comments. I'm not a prude, but a lot of that type of language is just stupid and boring. Someone is doing a good job: either commenters or moderators. Comments are usually pretty clever and funny. Can't turn off notifications of trending! Turned off on phone. I can view list/panel. Can't change!",4,0
This app is trash. Videos constantly stop/buffer even when I'm on perfect wifi and cell service. Photos barely load. After scrolling my main feed for literally less than two minutes every post I look at struggles to open. The comments section lags on pretty much every post. Especially if it's a post with a photo/video. Most of the time the photo/video overlaps the comments section anyway. Currently using a Galaxy Note+ and previously on a Note 8. Use Relay for Reddit instead.,1,0
"App does not minimise videos after watching, scrolling through the comments with a finger width to read them because the video will not close.",2,0
"Fun from boredom on a daily basis, commenting back-and -forth with Redditors on (lots of unique) content from around the globe.",4,3
I'll stop using Boost app which I've paid for if you guys provide option to highlight new comments on a post.,3,0
"App is fine but the updates always contain a lot of crashing bugs, so it becomes annoying to update. Latest updates added even more ads so the first comment of a post you open is an ad. Annoying enough to use an alternative client.",2,0
Video posts are stuck on full-screen and won't let you view comments. Occasionally it works but randomly,3,0
"Doesn't let me submit my posts... I tried to make comments for a couple days before posting but it's still saying that my account does not meet the posting requirements. Idk why I did everything they told me to do, I even reported this problem but they are still removing my post....",1,0
"Great news, community and comments",5,0
"Reddit is great. However, this app is not up to snuff. Here are some problems I run into every day. - Videos/Pictures/Comments take way too long to load - Videos will be blurry the second time they play, or if you scrub the video - After loading a thread and collapsing comments all comments will magically expand after a few seconds. This happens with every thread - Videos will not disappear when scrolling down to read comments (if you don't finish the video) I would say more but I'm out of space",2,0
Clicking the comments of video posts freezes the app,1,0
"comments are not showing with new update. click on a thread and video covers fulls screen, comments do not load. reddit crashes",1,0
Can't read comments on video posts. So many new bugs made me go back to the website.,1,0
"Ads on ads on ads.. Ads when looking through posts, ads at the top of comments, they're everywhere!! It wasn't always like this... It a nice app for browsing Reddit, but way too many freaking ads!!",3,0
