"I love all the quirky, funny subs like What could go wrong? and Don't dead open inside. Also, animal videos like Barkour! I'm so glad that the subs I look at are not full of gross and vulgar comments. I'm not a prude, but a lot of that type of language is just stupid and boring. Someone is doing a good job: either commenters or moderators. Comments are usually pretty clever and funny. Can't turn off notifications of trending! Turned off on phone. I can view list/panel. Can't change!",4,0
This app is trash. Videos constantly stop/buffer even when I'm on perfect wifi and cell service. Photos barely load. After scrolling my main feed for literally less than two minutes every post I look at struggles to open. The comments section lags on pretty much every post. Especially if it's a post with a photo/video. Most of the time the photo/video overlaps the comments section anyway. Currently using a Galaxy Note+ and previously on a Note 8. Use Relay for Reddit instead.,1,0

I'll stop using Boost app which I've paid for if you guys provide option to highlight new comments on a post.,3,0
"App is fine but the updates always contain a lot of crashing bugs, so it becomes annoying to update. Latest updates added even more ads so the first comment of a post you open is an ad. Annoying enough to use an alternative client.",2,0

"Doesn't let me submit my posts... I tried to make comments for a couple days before posting but it's still saying that my account does not meet the posting requirements. Idk why I did everything they told me to do, I even reported this problem but they are still removing my post....",1,0
"Great news, community and comments",5,0
"Reddit is great. However, this app is not up to snuff. Here are some problems I run into every day. - Videos/Pictures/Comments take way too long to load - Videos will be blurry the second time they play, or if you scrub the video - After loading a thread and collapsing comments all comments will magically expand after a few seconds. This happens with every thread - Videos will not disappear when scrolling down to read comments (if you don't finish the video) I would say more but I'm out of space",2,0
Clicking the comments of video posts freezes the app,1,0

"The app is better on iPhone. When viewing a comment thread you've replied to for example, you can only view the prior comment. Not the whole chain. Hope they make it better in the future.",3,0
The app works like garbage. Most of the time it wont even load and even when it loads the experience is pretty disappointing to say the least. Full of glitches and bugs reading the comments from a video post is impossible because it keeps scrolling back to the video when you are looking at the comments,2,1
Haven't spent too much time on it...not sure what's up with not being able to leave many comments...kind of dislike that,4,0
It's like Twitter if comments and posts get up or down voted .,5,0

"Really slow lately, comments take a long time to load sometimes posts don't load at all",2,0
Stupid. New so I can only apparently make a comment once and then have to sit and wait for another five minutes before i can comment on anything else. Wth? I'm just going back to Imgur where it's basically the same and I can comment on whatever I want without waiting forever.,1,1
Latest update puts ads in the comments. These are very intrusive and completely ruins an otherwise good experience.,1,1

"I love Reddit as a platform, but have issues with this app. Lots of glitching when it comes to loading posts and comments. Other big gripe is that it absolutely destroys my battery; it's more battery hungry than mobile games.",3,0
"I'm getting notifications for comments to my post, but when I go to my actual post to read them there's nothing there",1,0
"Once again official Reddit has been broke with the latest update. When I try to view comments on any video, it takes ages to load. The screen freezes, can't even watch the video and if I want to actually see comments I have to wait ~20 seconds. The videos used to show the comments just fine but now it forces you into some sort of full screen mode when you look at the post, freezing the app entirely. It's been like this for weeks. I kept hoping they would fix it but they just don't care.",1,1
"Whenever I try and read the comments on a vreddit video the video stays the same size. This means when I scroll I can basically only see one comment at a time as the video takes up most of the screen. It may not seem like much, but it makes the app unusable.",1,8
"This app is riddled with advertising. They want $6.99/month to remove them. 1 out of every 4 posts is advertising related or promotional. Tough to view content, recently its reposts or from another media site. The comments section needs to be collapsed at default instead of using a button to move to the next parent comment. They block other apps from posting videos to the site, only this app can do it as of July 2020",3,30
"It would no let me post my first comment It said ""you do that to much"" well do what to much. What is that? It cant be posting that was my 1st post",2,0

"Comments don't load properly, videos don't have sound, unless you go back to the main thread, and scroll down to the posts.Reading comments would make your screen freeze for a few seconds.I have an IOS device and the app is ok there, but having an android phone which I use most of the time, and the app acting as trashy as it is now is reason enough to rate 1 star.Fix it please.",1,83
"Easy to use, but here are couple improvements I'd like: 1) Posts older than a year cannot be seen easily, and cannot be voted or commented upon. 2) Please allow for direct downloading from the app, so that we don't have to go to the browser version for that.",4,4
"They are censoring free speech, just like Twitter! If you're not part of the ""black community"" you can't make comments on anything. It's really sad when you can't put out the facts, they block you everywhere! How can I change my icon back to normal, not some virtue signaling.",1,5
Please bring back visible user profile pics. They make keeping track of comment threads much easier.,5,1
"Terrible to use, going onto any sub with pictures stops the app from loading correctly until a hard reset, comments don't load correctly at first and jump back to the top when they do, commenting doesn't work sometimes. Maybe they should spend less time censoring conservatives are more time fixing their app.",1,5
"I am not able to load my home screen. Every time I try to login, the same message flashes ""We had some trouble getting to reddit"". It has nothing to do with my internet connection as other apps which use network connection work fine. Please fix this. The images are not loading. Takes much more time to process comments. While posting, Most of the times is says ""Unable to post"". Fix this.",1,151
Good content. Would be nice to easily see old comments,4,0
It's a great app because you can choose what kind of content you do or don't want to see and because you can reward people for cool posts and comments.,5,1
Opening comments of a video just fullscreens and freezes the app,1,3
Love this app. So organized and the award system is very clever. Only thing is android users shoul be able to see comment karma,5,0
"One of THE best social media.! Last update brought a lot of bugs, when u scroll down on a video the video goes up but the comments won't go all the way up, it suddenly disappears half way.. can't retract a comment thread by holding.. and unbearable lag sometimes.. I like playing music on the background which browsing Reddit.. so making the music stop when watching a video and the continuing it back would be a great addition... I don't always wanna go back and start the music again..",5,7
The best meme hub :D. But i hate the fact that commenting even on a different subreddit has such a long cooldown of 10 mins. Idk why this is and its really very annoying. Maybe decrease the cooldown.,5,0

My itnernet is working fine and all other apps are working well in case u think otherwise. Deal with the issue asap. It is getting frustrating now. Edit: the issue is not yet resolved. Suggestion: you should give option to share pictures in inbox.",1,27
"Recent updates have broken the already bad video feature. Videos will freeze my note 10+, prevent me from reading comments or even pausing the video.",1,1

"Completely unusable, you touch a video to see the comments and the apo freezes",1,2
"Crashes when pressing the ""more comments"" button",4,0
"This app has gone downhill over the past 4 years I've been on it. The app has very buggy updates. Recently, they updated the app to make it more intuitive to spend real money on awards but broke the comments displayed on videos. The videos no longer minimize when browsing comments which makes able to only see about one comment at a time. In the last few updates they broke messages so that you would get constantly notified about old messages. That lasted for over a month before it was fixed.",2,315
"Pretty good, although it has a glitch where if you press on the comments if a post, it has a chance of splitting your screen so that the upper half you can still see the post and the lower half that you can scroll through comments (which usually you can just scroll through the comments and leave the post up the top).",4,6
Terrible after the last update. I am unable to load stuff and it wont let me comment. Wth.,2,0
"I would give a five but as of a recent update, when you watch a video now you can't really scroll through comments at the same time. You can only view like the height of one comment and have to try and scroll through it. Would like to look at comments on vids again.",3,1
"I've been using reddit for 2 years and I love it I can find a subreddit for anything I'm interested in and it's easy to use but since the update it's been very glitchy and lagging.

I know it not my phone because I dont have any problems with anything else but reddit",3,0
"Up until recently, the last 2-3 weeks, I've had zero problems with this all. A couple weeks ago it just began not always loading correctly. There are times when nothing will load and other times when the original posts will be there but zero comments even though it says there are comments. If they can fix that glitch the app will go back to perfecto",4,102
Reddit is the best! Except for how suddenly the comment section is teeny tiny on my phone when there's a video.,3,0
"Tiny, tiny bit confusing with the rating of the comments and things but the app itself has been very useful!",4,0
The quality of the app plummets every update. Now I can't even look at comments on videos without the app freezing. Its completely clear that the people who run and develop the app don't care about the quality of it. What a massive joke.,1,4
"When I scroll down on posts with videos or gigs, it stays on the screen instead of scrolling away. So I only have like 2 inches of space to be able to read anything or comment. So annoying.",1,5
Recent update has bugs. I'm having issues with vertical videos. When clicking on the comments it brings the video to full screen (I just want to read the comments) and it lags out the interface. Super annoying.,1,4
The app is almost unusable first when I click on the post to read comment it basically hides the comments so I can't read them until I exit and go back in thenAs I use the app it starts off fine but as I use it more it'll get slower and slower until it freezes and forces me to force close and clear cache before I will be able to use it again. Also mods delete my post then post it as there own good job guys.,1,2
"I posted 3 comments in a 1 hour window and the app stopped me from doing that because apparently I was ""doing that too much"". Then what is the purpose of this app?",2,0
"I'm not sure if this is a bug, or if you're just experimenting with the videos in the comment section. But after opening the comments under a video you can no longer ""scroll"" the video away. So when trying to read the comments I literally have maybe an inch and half room to read. It's impossible to read multiple comments. I believe it's been like this for over 2 weeks. Once you guys fix this I'll change the star but his is awfully annoying. And FFS let us copy messages in chat",1,129
Find it's forced opening of videos and how it keeps them over the comments exceedingly annoying.,2,0
"Usually one place to find answers and other's recommendations based on their experience and opinions. I like the fact that it allows anyone to share their experiences and ask opinions opinions to make finding hardest of situations simple. The app is so simplistic that it feels like reading a book. However, I would like to see an option where user can upload image, gif to a comment section of the post.",4,3
[Edit: Seriously what moron thought up this idiotic mechanic? Its mind boggling] Being able to only comment once every 8 minutes makes it impossible to have a conversation. Devs are geniuses.,1,1
In the last couple of weeks there is a bug where you can't minimize videos and they take up the entire space of the comment section. Tried reinstalling and it still does it.,1,0
"Recent update, videos now longer scroll out of frame when you view comments, so you get a tiny viewing area for comments under the video",2,1
"The last 2 updates have messed up the app, so frustrating! It freezes on videos and the new layout of videos when trying to scroll through comments and only being able to see maybe an inch at a time beneath the video, please change it back! I love Reddit but I hate using it now.",2,10
"I went to comment on an 'Ask reddit' post, and it said 'You are doing that to much, try again in nine minutes'. I'm sorry, but I don't want to wait 10 minutes to make another comment. Simply outrageous. This app is very over rated for what it truely is.",1,0

"Every now and then it takes some time to load images or comments but it's a fantastic app where you can relate with other people, or you can ask questions that you are embarrassed or afraid to ask, but most importantly it's an app where you laugh so hard and where you find just some awesome things.",5,10

"Reddit is a good platform for user to make a post, and others comment.",4,0

"The app takes over more than half your screen for images/ videos while you try to browse comments. It also forces you to look at the ""Popular"" tab when your ""Home"" runs out of new content - and since you can't filter subs you dislike out from ""Popular"", you can't filter out all the subs you want to avoid seeing",1,0
Well designed app. I really like how you can drag the skip comment thread button around.,5,0
I love this community. I feel safe in the comments and everyone there is very wholsome. 1000/10,5,0
App is glitchy when you try to scroll up on videos to see comments,3,0
Only problem is when trying to view comments on a video post you have to wait til the video is finished to be able to see the comments clearly. The layout is very poor when videos are playing ie - cant read comments well because they are hidden by how big the video displays. It is a new feature recently but it slightly irritates me,4,7

You have to press play again for it to downsize so to can read the comments. Also, I hate that they changed the ""view more comments"" to blue. I used to be able to scroll super fast to find links in the thread, but now that's pretty much impossible. And when you click ""view more comments"" it doesn't do anything half the time.",1,0
"Videos often stop midway through and can't be replayed. Now, when I click a video post to see the comments, the app freezes and does not show anything but the video thumbnail on the entire screen.",1,0
"The comments don't load at all when trying to open them, especially on videos. whenever you do the video just gets larger and only shows the ""write a comment"" bar. Sometimes you can see the comments if you open and close writing your own comment, but that doesn't work for everything and will often fail. Its annoying and it's not being fixed.",1,105
New update is trash. Videos freeze the app up constantly when you click on the comments and it goes full screen.,1,0
"I love Reddit, but the app kinda sucks. I certainly prefer it over the online site, but the app always seems to have bugs. Videos don't always play correctly (if at all), comments don't always display correctly, and there's some other bugs that the devs just overall need to fix",3,4
Complete garbage with every update. With every update it's like the app becomes worse. The videos take up like 90% on the screen while I try looking through the comment section. Most of the time videos/gifs freeze up and don't play. App randomly closes out now.,1,7
"The app stopped working over the last few days. When you go to open it, all you get is a dark screen with the bottom bar to post or comment. You can't actually see anything else. Nothing loads.",1,5
"Why do all my posts and comments get instantly ""liked"" by me? I don't want to ""like"" the stuff I write.",4,0

"Guys, posts and comments are not loading. This started even before the last update I got and is still happening. Contact me if you need a guinea pig or more info.",1,1
Unusable touch interface in comments. Want to follow a link? How about we collapse this thread instead. Want to expand the thread and try again? How about going to this user's profile instead! It's like a precision game that I lose everytime. update: the mobile website is obsessed with trying to get you to use the app. no means no! stop asking. Still terrible in 2020 Asked me if I was enjoying the app. I said no. It said please give us feedback. I said sure. Then it sent me to a help request.,1,2
When i go to upvoted it won't let me go directly to the post i have to go on the sub and find the post to see the comments,1,1

"Till now I have a few complaints. After a few week or so the posts stop loading I don't know why, so uninstalling and reinstalling works. Done that 4 times by now. Don't have any problems with that but it should not happen. Also that commenting once every 9 minutes feature irritates me a lot, can't you decrease the cooldown atleast?",3,73
"The app is very buggy and slow. Videos take a long time to load and it would be nice if you could control the stream quality as it randomly changes and you cannot do anything about it . Images load slowly too, if they even load at all. The new update made a video/image take up 3/4 of the screen when you are scrolling through comments.",1,109
It's got a major issue. It always has trouble connecting. So other social media apps are working fine. Reddit always had this problem. There are many other issues as well. Like it hangs while I'm scrolling through my feed. It takes so long to load the comments. It has become so much buggy. Please fix it.,1,0

"I like Reddit. There's a subreddit (topic) for just about everything so theres a ton of variety.

"Reddit's updates are such a hit or miss. Sometimes, they add a bunch of great new stuff like more moderator features. Othertimes, they remove the snoos or add giant icons in the comment threads.

I hate to lower my review. But whatever you did to the comment feature is absolute GARBAGE!!!! I can barely read more than a line or two at a time because you decided to make the image/gif take up 90% of the screen. It also freezes the app AT LEAST 50% of the time. Please fix this.

"New update has this very disruptive bug where after clicking into a video post, I'm unable scroll down the comments section at all and the video and app just freezes. I have to force close the app and restart every time this happens. Please fix!!!",1,1
I don't like that you are limiting the amount of replies or comments that I can add to any post with a time clock. Fix this.,3,0
"I don't know if it's a new video player feature or a bug, but videos now take up 80% of the screen and comments are unreadable. Comments can't be read until the entire video is done playing, and since reddit videos freeze 90% of the time, sometimes comments are unreadable completely. Skipping to the end of the video just freezer the video player.",3,1
Ban for an upvoting content and comments is unacceptable,1,0
"Excellent site but the app is buggy / frustrating in many ways. Videos are particularly buggy going to and from full screen, long comment threads are challenging to track, etc.",4,0
Horrible. Way to easy to scroll to the top unintentionally and some videos you cannot minimize so you can you read one comment at a time,1,0
JUST BECAUSE I DONT COMMENT ON POSTS DOESN'T MEAN THAT I CANT POST I SHOULD BE ABLE TO POST WHENEVER I WANT SO STFU BOTS other than that I guess its good,4,0
"Gif and video quality ALWAYS defaults for lowest quality on the first play. And its never been fixed, with no option to change quality. It'd be like instagram but every picture is blurred for 2 mins first, or youtube on 160p first playthrough. Your app is half useless until it works. *edit - recent update makes videos stay on screen while trying to scroll comments. I can't even...",1,25
Videos dont minimize when trying to read comments,1,2
"Reddit suspends my account for no reason without warning, an email, or any form of notice as to why. I hadn't even posted or commented on anything yet, and they suspend my account?",1,0
"Long time mobile lurker here. Anyone else having a new problem where reddit freezes up? It happens when I am playing a video and click on comments while the video is playing. The video tries to go full screen then freezes with parts of the UI still up, but they don't respond when clicked/ tapped. The back arrow on Android is also unresponsive. Closing the task and reopening it lets me get back to scrolling my life away.",4,0
Could be better with allowing comments in anonymous mode,2,0
"Videos/video-comments are bugged. Video fills the whole screen, when opening comments. Half of the time you got 1cm to read comments, the other half it crashes. Will update my review when fixed. Thanks!",1,7
I wish they changed the way comments looked its kind of confusing for new people. Other then that great app...,5,1
Please fix the goddamned video/comment nonsense. Its beyond annoying having your app freeze and force closed everytime I watch something,1,3
I find it strange you can only comment once,4,1
